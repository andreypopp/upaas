# Î¼PaaS

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Nano-Platform-as-a-Service utilizes Docker containers and gitreceive to build
and run applications.

It is heavily based on Dokku but doesn't use Heroku buildpacks, instead it is
uses stacks declared directly as Dockerfiles and build instructions declared as
Makefiles.
